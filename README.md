## üôå I am Cunliang Geng

I am a research software engineer at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl) with a background in computational structural biology.

I am passionate about scientific software development and the application of AI in life sciences to tackle complex challenges.

## Projects

### ‚≠ê AI for Biology

#### Protein-protein interaction prediction
- [DeepRank](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank): a deep learning framework for identifying 3D protein-protein interactions
- [iScore](https://github.com/DeepRank/iScore): an MPI supported software for ranking protein-protein docking models based on random walk graph kernel and support vector machines

#### Binding affinity prediction
- [PRODIGY-LIG](https://github.com/haddocking/prodigy-lig): a [webserver](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/prodigy/lig) for large-scale prediction of binding affinity (‚àÜG) in protein-ligand complexes
- [iSEE](https://github.com/haddocking/iSee): a random forest model for prediction of binding affinity changes upon single point mutations (‚àÜ‚àÜG) in protein-protein complexes

#### DNA barcode identification
- [TaxoTagger](https://mycoai.github.io/taxotagger/latest/): a python library powered by deep learning and semantic search for DNA barcode identification

### ‚≠ê Omics Data Processing
- [NPLinker](https://nplinker.github.io/nplinker/latest/): a python framework for integrating multi-omics data to discover new microbial natural products
- [MatchMS](https://github.com/matchms/matchms): a python library for processing mass spectrometry data and computing similarity scores between mass spectra
- [pdb2sql](https://github.com/DeepRank/pdb2sql): a python library for parsing, manipulation and analysis of PDB files using SQL queries

### ‚≠ê Federated Learning
- [Vantage6](https://vantage6.ai/): an infrastructure for federated analysis and learning, powered by kubernetes and docker.

### ‚≠ê Healthcare Data Processing
- [FHIR for GameBus](https://fhir-layer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a data harmonization microservice to transform healthcare data into the standard [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) format.
